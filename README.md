# Simple Minecraft Server Manager
### Recomended to use [Game Scripts by Veskeli](https://github.com/veskeli/GameScriptsByVeskeli) To download this script
This is standalone but still saves everything to GameScriptsbyVeskeli folder
(Game Scripts by Veskeli Is not needed)
## Issues
+ Guide needs rework
+ Guide doesn't contain everything yet
+ Not everything supported yet
+ Ngrok not supported yet
+ Server file download not supported yet
+ Error detection not supported
+ Saves everything to appdata(Server files)
